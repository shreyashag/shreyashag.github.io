      <description>Hey everyone,
It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I posted something, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with work and other things. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot of scrapes recently and while trying to reduce the code I would have to write, I stumbled upon something.
Have you heard about Pandas?It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic library which not only is useful for maintaining data structures in it&amp;rsquo;s famous Dataframe, but also helped me cut out BeautifulSoup (another awesome library which I used to use for web parsing) completely!</description>
