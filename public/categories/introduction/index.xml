      <description>Hello and welcome to my blog. You can read more about me here. I have previously used blogs on wordpress and blogger. On wordpress to write a blog called Pi2Projects, where I wrote about my experiments with the Raspberry Pi 2. I have pulled the blog down, and now this blog will be my main blogging medium now.
Speaking of medium, I also have a profile there, you can follow me @shreyashag.</description>
