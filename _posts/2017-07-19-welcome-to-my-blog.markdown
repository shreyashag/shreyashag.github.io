Hello and welcome to my blog. You can read more about me [here](http://shreyashagarwal.in/personal-page/about). I have previously used blogs on wordpress and blogger. On wordpress to write a blog called Pi2Projects, where I wrote about my experiments with the Raspberry Pi 2. I have pulled the blog down, and now this blog will be my main blogging medium now.

Speaking of medium, I also have a profile there, you can follow me [@shreyashag](https://medium.com/@shreyashag).

I am using Jekyll to write this blog, which is a new experience for me but the workflow is a lot of fun. The post is written in Markdown format, and a commit generates the site for me thanks to Github Pages.
I may consider moving the blog off Github Pages, because of some of the limitations of using Jekyll on Github Pages, such as being able to use only gems that are whitelisted by GitHub Pages. However, that will only happen when I need such functionality.
Moreover, Jekyll provides for programmability, so if the functionality is not too complex, I'll probably code it myself or search for it on the net.

Jekyll is actively developed and has a huge following. Despite having to use a Ruby environment (something I am new to), I am so far finding the experience fun.

I also developed a webpage for myself, that can be opened by clicking on my name at the header on this page. (Or you can click on [https://shreyashagarwal.in/personal-page](https://shreyashagarwal.in/personal-page)). I used Typed.Js for the slick typing animation on the homepage and the design was using the Bootstrap Cover template ( which can be found in the examples folder of the Bootstrap source folder on github).

Oh and when you see the webpage, check out the awesome social icons at the bottom. They were designed using Font-Awesome. Also follow me on twitter! [@shreyash_ag](https://twitter.com/shreyash_ag).

More posts coming soon, and in the next one I'm going to explain how I got https for my domain for free!
