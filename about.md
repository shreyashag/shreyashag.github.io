Hi! My name is Shreyash Agarwal. I mainly do web development app development. I am also interested in the field of computer vision and machine learning.

I was born and brought up in Kolkata, India and I have loved computers since the time I got my hands on them. I also enjoy listening to music and occasionally play the guitar too! You can listen to the songs I recorded with my band Paperfly - Murderers and Power Me Home at <a href ="https://www.reverbnation.com/paperfly">Reverbnation.com/paperfly</a>
